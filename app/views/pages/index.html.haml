  %h1 Rails CRM
  %p
    Rails CRM is an opensource Customer Relations Management application. Intended to be similiar to Paid CRM's, Rails CRM is going to be the bare bones minimum for a CRM but yet can be cloned and modified however you please.

    Rails CRM uses Mongoid and Mongodb, Twitter Bootstrap, Devise for authentication, as well as HAML and SASS. I prefer to use nosql and Mongodb is our favorite. I looked at a few other opensource CRM's but did not find any that used mongodb. Rails CRM became a pet project and was a starting point for one of RebelHolds interns Rick Carlino.
